## Amongst many VR devices, why Samsung Gear VR?
VR device can provide a whole new experience that no other device could ever offer. But sadly, most of these devices are still too expensive, and it makes most of consumers to feel difficult to have a bit of taste about VR.
So we've been looking for a chance to make our game available for most of people, and Samsung Gear VR was a perfect fit!
It's surely one of the cheapest and the most popular VR devices so far. We are hoping that Toy Clash can lower the hurdles of popularizing VR experience.

## What's the plans after launching?
In order to reach more players, we will gradually increase the number of languages ​​and platforms supported.
By the 1Q of 2017, the game will be playable with Oculus and Google Daydream, and HTC Vive by the following quarter.
